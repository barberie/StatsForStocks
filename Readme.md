<h3>Stats For Stocks</h3>

<h2>Intro</h2>

<p>The StatsForStocks code collects data for all scripts from nseindia.com and performs analysis to get various statistical data about them. It is a start to computational investing. As of now it only calculates <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharpe_ratio">Shapres Ratio Information</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sortino_ratio">Sortino Ratio Information</a> ratio. However, it will be expanded to enlarge its scope to make (semi-wise) investment decisions. This is currently pre-alpha state, however, in case you decide to give it a try and have any suggestions for improvements, do let me know.</p>
